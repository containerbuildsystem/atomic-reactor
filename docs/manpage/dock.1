.SH COMMANDS


\fBdock [OPTIONS] build
.PP\fR
  This command enables you to build images. There are several methods for
  performing the build: inside a build container using docker from host,
  inside a build container using new instance of docker, or within current
  environment
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --json JSON           path to build json
  --build-image BUILD_IMAGE
                        name of build image to use (build image type has to
                        match method)
  --image IMAGE         name under the image will be accessible
  --git-url URL         URL to git repo
  --git-path GIT_PATH   path to Dockerfile within git repo (default is ./)
  --git-commit GIT_COMMIT
                        checkout this commit (default is master)
  --source-registry REGISTRY
                        registry to pull base image from
  --source-registry-insecure
                        allow connecting to source registry over plain http
  --target-registries [REGISTRY [REGISTRY ...]]
                        list of registries to push image to
  --target-registries-insecure
                        allow connecting to target registries over plain http
  --dont-pull-base-image
                        don't pull or update base image specified in
                        dockerfile
  --load-plugin [PLUGIN_FILE [PLUGIN_FILE ...]]
                        list of files where plugins live
  --method {hostdocker,privileged,here}
                        choose method for building image: 'hostdocker' mounts
                        socket inside container, 'privileged' spawns
                        privileged container and runs separate docker instance
                        inside and finally 'here' executesbuild in current
                        environment


\fBdock [OPTIONS] create-build-image
.PP\fR
  Create build image; dock installs itself inside and is capable of building
  images within this image.
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dock-latest         put latest dock inside (from public git)
  --dock-remote-git DOCK_REMOTE_GIT
                        URL to git repo with dock (has to contain setup.py)
  --dock-local-path DOCK_LOCAL_PATH
                        path to directory with dock (has to contain setup.py)
  --dock-tarball-path DOCK_TARBALL_PATH
                        path to distribution tarball with dock
  --use-cache           use cache to build image (may be faster, but not up to
                        date)


\fBdock [OPTIONS] inside-build
.PP\fR
  We do expect we are inside container, therefore we'll read build
  configuration from json at '/run/share/build.json'and when the build is
  done, results are written in that dir so dock from host may read those.
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT         input plugin name
  --input-arg INPUT_ARG
                        argument for input plugin (in form of 'key=value'),
                        see input plugins to know what arguments they accept
                        (can be specified multiple times)
  --dont-pull-base-image
                        don't pull or update base image specified in
                        dockerfile
  --substitute SUBSTITUTE
                        substitute values in build json (key=value, or
                        plugin_type.plugin_name.key=value)
